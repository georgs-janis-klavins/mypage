                        <p>The high-pressure UV chiller booster PRO 10 provides a 70-140 bar (PSI 1015,26 – 2030.53) of pressure within the Smart Cooling™ system. The pumping station houses a uniquely developed high-pressure pump, along with valves and the electronics for a fully automated operation of the adiabatic cooling system. The nestled block of ultraviolet lamps purify and sterilize water and protect against bacteria, including harmful Legionella.</p>

                        <p>A four-stage water treatment system removes limescale, Legionella bacteria, dust and other undesirable contaminants. The water is initially filtered to reduce dirt and other pollutants. Then the structure of lime molecules is altered, preventing sediment of limescale to occur on the surfaces of the air-cooling equipment components. A process allowed by the exclusive Smart Cooling™ electro-magnetic magnet and BIO tablets, which offer double protection for metal parts against rust. Finally, the water is radiated with UV rays to prevent Legionella and other bacteria formation in the water.</p>
